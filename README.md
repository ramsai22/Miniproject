## Blockchain-Driven Secure Supply Chain Management with IoT-Based Cold Storage Monitoring
This project focuses on the integration of IoT-based cold storage monitoring, edge intelligence, and blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and reliable management of temperature-sensitive supply chains. The system continuously monitors environmental conditions and applies intelligent decision-making to maintain compliance while providing tamper-evident traceability of critical operational events.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Blockchain-Driven Secure Supply Chain Management with IoT-Based Cold Storage Monitoring is designed to address challenges such as lack of transparency, delayed response to temperature violations, and data tampering in cold-chain logistics. Traditional cold storage systems often rely on centralized monitoring and manual intervention, which can lead to inefficiencies and compliance risks.
This project introduces an intelligent framework where IoT sensors collect real-time temperature data, a local decision agent evaluates operational conditions, and selective edge offloading is triggered during uncertain scenarios. All critical decisions are securely recorded on a blockchain ledger, enabling transparent auditing and trust among supply chain stakeholders.


## Features
Real-time IoT-based temperature monitoring
Confidence-aware intelligent decision-making
Selective edge offloading for uncertain conditions
Blockchain-based tamper-evident decision logging
Reduced communication overhead through local inference
Scalable and modular system architecture
Secure and transparent audit trail for cold-chain operations

Operating System:-
64-bit Windows 10 / 11 or Ubuntu 20.04+

Development Environment:-
Python 3.8 or later

Frameworks and Libraries:-
TensorFlow / PyTorch for intelligent decision modeling

NumPy and SciPy for numerical computation:-
Matplotlib for data visualization

Web3.py for blockchain interaction:-

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of four primary layers:
IoT Sensing Layer – Collects real-time temperature data from cold storage units
Local Intelligence Layer – Performs fast decision-making under normal conditions
Edge Intelligence Layer – Provides high-capacity decision support during uncertainty
Blockchain Layer – Records offloaded decisions and compliance events in an immutable ledger
